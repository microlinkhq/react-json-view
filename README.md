This adds a custom event handler for the main lib, its used for a specific purpose of another project, but it might be useful for someone else. If you don't like the customEvent icon you're free to fork and change it to your liking.

In general, I would recommend using the original lib, as it is more stable and has more features.

**WARNING** the general way color themes work is switched on this lib ever since 1.26.0, so if you're using this lib, you might want to switch to the original lib or make a fork of this lib and change the color scheme back to the original one.
